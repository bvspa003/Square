Today, last-mile delivery is broken. Grocery shopping, one of the most frequent errands, has become a hassle for millions—long trips, heavy lifting, and constant uncertainty about inventory. While 90% of people prefer shopping online, over 74% still find delivery too expensive. In fact, 87% would order online more often if it were cheaper and more convenient. On the other side, supermarkets and retailers are struggling. Hiring part-time delivery workers is costly and inefficient: recruitment takes time, scheduling is complex, and constant turnover drives up training costs. The result? An industry plagued by inefficiency, rising costs, and growing customer frustration. Traditional delivery models are costly, slow, and unreliable—creating what we call the “last-mile crisis.”

This is where we come in. Our Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADR) transform last-mile delivery into a low-risk, high-ROI, and climate-positive service. Imagine AI-powered, vision-only robots that safely navigate sidewalks, bike lanes, and building entrances. Modular by design, they can handle grocery, parcel, and food delivery—each item secured in specialized compartments. Unlike expensive human-driven models, our robots slash delivery costs by up to 70%, reduce energy demand by 80%, and cut the carbon footprint by 90%.

The beauty of ADR lies in versatility. They work across B2C (business-to-customer), C2C (customer-to-customer), and B2B (business-to-business) deliveries. That means a single fleet can serve households, local businesses, and enterprise supply chains—scaling predictably and sustainably. Compared to current alternatives, our robots are faster, cheaper, and cleaner, redefining what “convenient delivery” really means.

The market is massive: a $500M total available market today, with $200M serviceable and $15M immediately obtainable. Our roadmap is lean but ambitious: design and build in 2025, regulatory approvals and pilots by early 2026, commercial launch mid-2026, national expansion in 2027, and international rollout by 2029.

This is not just about innovation—it’s about reshaping the future of urban logistics. With a founding team deeply specialized in design, manufacturing, electronics, and business operations, we are uniquely positioned to deliver.

We’re not just building delivery robots. We’re building a future where convenience, cost-efficiency, and sustainability move together—clean moves, clean mission.
